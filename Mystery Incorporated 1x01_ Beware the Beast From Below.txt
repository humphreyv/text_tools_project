SCENE: Crystal Cove Police Department. The gang are celebrating in a cell.
----
Velma: Another mystery bites the dust!
Fred: Way to go, gang!
Daphne: Let's celebrate!
Scooby: Yeah, celebrate.
(Sheriff Stone closes the door to the cell)
Sheriff Stone: Better idea.
Fred: Aw, come on, sheriff.
Sheriff Stone: Just cork it. You see this badge? Know why it's here?
Velma: It came with the shirt?
Sheriff Stone: It's here because if there's a crime, I solve it.
(Sheriff Stone walks to the door)
Sheriff Stone: Oh, and by the way, I've called all your parents, who, by now, I have on speed dial. Oh, are you in trouble. Especially you, Fred. Say hi to dad, the Mayor.
(Sheriff Stone leaves the room)
Daphne: Just once, it would be nice if someone thanked us for solving a mystery.
Fred: Good thing we're not in this to be liked.
Fred: ...Maybe that didn't come out quite right.

SCENE: Crystal Cove Spook Museum. Velma is a tour guide for a group of Crystal Cove tourists.
________________




Velma: Welcome to the Crystal Cove haunted tour. I'm your ghoulish guide Velma. The first documented case of the curse of Crystal Cove is from 1630, when a garrison of Spanish conquistadors mysteriously vanished from the harbor.
Female Tourist: Oh, that is so scary! Where did they go?
Velma: What part of the word "mystery" didn't you understand? The curse struck again in 1765 when an entire town of missionaries likewise disappeared. Anyway, things were pretty quiet until 100 years later, when Cletus Darrow found gold here and renamed the town Crystal Cove. Most people thought the curse had been lifted, until the entire Darrow family disappeared one Halloween and was never seen again. (Velma plays a tape of the Darrow family screaming)
Velma: Moving on.
(Velma leads the tourists inside to the exhibits)
Velma: Since the disappearance of the Darrow family, Crystal Cove has been a hub of paranormal activity. You might recognize some of our more famous visitors. Ghostly deep sea diver Captain Cutler, Miner '49er, Charlie the Haunted Robot, and who could forget the terrifying stylings of Space Kook? Not me.
Male Tourist: Oh! How frightening!
Female Tourist: Oh! Absolutely blood-curdling.
Velma: Not really. They all turned out to be fakes.
(The tourists gasp and talk amongst themselves)
Velma: Yep. Captain Cutler was just some guy who was hijacking boats. Miner '49er's real name was Hank. Charlie belonged to Mr. Jenkins, who thought it would be easier to run an amusement park with a crazy robot. And Space Kook? Oh, don't get me started! Ooh!
(Angie and Dale Dinkley, Velma's parents, cover her mouth)
Dale Dinkley: Thank you, Velma. Well, that concludes the terror-ific tour.
Angie Dinkley: Don't forget to stop in at the haunted snack shop for souvenirs and your complimentary undead sipper cup.
(The tourists run off)
Angie Dinkley: What do you think you were doing?
Dale Dinkley: Are you trying to destroy our business?
Velma: Reboot, parentals. I was just being honest.
Dale Dinkley: Those were isolated incidents in Crystal Cove's otherwise-unblemished supernatural past of hauntings and paranormal happenings.
Velma: Your generation's belief, not mine. My generation, we only got one thing on our minds...

Fred: Solving mysteries and building traps.
Mayor Jones: That's 2 things, Fred.
Fred: You know what I mean, Dad. We just want answers. Is that wrong?
Mayor Jones: Tickling chin whiskers, Fred. The Mayor's son is supposed to set an example.
Fred: I'm trying, dad. In fact, just yesterday, I entered one of my traps in the district science fair. It was rejected for not actually having anything to do with science, but--
Mayor Jones: I just don't want you to make a mistake you'll regret.
Fred: You mean like making a bad trap?
Mayor Jones: No! Life is not all about traps. It's also about...

Scooby: Pancakes. And bacon.
Shaggy: And sausages, and orange juice.

Paula Rogers: Don't forget to chew.
Colton Rogers: And breathe.
Shaggy: Mmm. Like, thanks, Mom and Dad.
Scooby: Yeah. Thanks, Mom and Dad.
Colton Rogers: Your mother and I are worried about this mystery phase you're going through. We're not saying find new friends, we're--
Paula Rogers: Yes, we are. Find new friends.
Shaggy: Oh, you guys have got nothing to worry about, man. Me and Scoob always play it safe. If there's danger...
Scooby: We run, fast. Really fast.
Shaggy: And as for our friends, if you guys just gave them a chance, you'd see...

SCENE: Blake Mansion. Daphne is sitting with her parents, Nan and Barty Blake.
________________




Daphne: The gang is misunderstood. We're just solving mysteries. All the kids are doing it.
Nan and Barty Blake: No, they're not.
Nan Blake: And what about this Fred Jones? Certainly, there must be other boys.
Daphne: Not like Fred. He's, like, one of those geniuses that no one understands until they're dead. He sees things different, and he wants to catch those different things in his traps.
Barty Blake: Honey, we just want you to go on to have a rich career, like your sisters.
(Barty Blake points at Daphne's sisters standing by: Daisy, Dawn, Dorothy, and Delilah. They hear a honk)
Daphne: Oh, that's Fred and the gang. Gotta go. Don't wanna be late for school! Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! Bye, Daisy! Bye, Dawn! Bye, Dorothy! Bye, Delilah!

SCENE: The sewers. Workers are using jackhammers, except for Worker 1, who is eating a strange-looking green slush from a cup.
________________




Worker 1: Hey, you sure you guys don't want any of this Fruitmeir's smoothie? Oh, it's delic- ahhhhh! 
(Worker 1 falls through a wall)
Worker 1: What the whozit? Which one of you broke that wall?
Worker 2: Wha- we barely touched it.
Worker 3: Is that another sewer?
Worker 1: Impossible! There's only one sewer, and we're in it- unless...
Worker 2: ...We've broken into another dimension?
Worker 1: No, idiot. We've busted through to one of the old Crystal Cove caves.
(The three workers are seen walking into the cave they have discovered. They approach a stack of barrels leaking green ooze. Worker 2 attempts to twist off the top of one of the barrels. Unable to open it, he knocks on the lid twice, stepping back when the barrel moves)
Worker 2: -Huh? I think there's something in there. What should we do?
Worker 1: Well, it's pretty clear, isn't it? Those are radioactive symbols- meaning whatever's inside is dangerous. Meaning we need to open it right away. We don't want whatever's in there to mess up our schedule.
(Worker 1 holds up a flashlight while the other two pry open a container with crowbars)
 Worker 2: Hey, I think I see someth--AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
(Growls and screams echo through the chamber)

SCENE: The Mystery Machine. Fred and Daphne are sitting in the front, with Scooby's head sticking out the passenger window. Velma and Shaggy are in the back.
________________




Velma: Why didn't you text me last night? I waited up for you.
(Shaggy swallows his food)
Shaggy: Um, like, me and Scoob ordered a pizza, and then we just fell asleep watching a Vincent Van Ghoul movie.
Velma: Okay, apology accepted. 
(She 'walks' her fingers up Shaggy's chest)
Velma: But I still missed you...
(She grabs the front of Shaggy's shirt and pulls him toward her with her lips puckered. Shaggy makes a sound of confusion and discomfort. He pulls her hands off his shirt apologetically)
Shaggy: Not here, Velma-- not in public.
Velma: Why? Daphne and Fred are going to find out sooner or later.
Shaggy: I'm not worried about them! It’s Scooby-Doo; he’s my best friend. I wanna break it to him, like, gently. I’m just waiting for the right time!
Velma: How about now - hey, Scoob- 
(She is interrupted by a manhole cover rocketing into the air, followed by billowing green gas. Fred slams on the brakes [as the girls shriek] to avoid getting hit by the projectile. It misses the van by a few feet and slams into the pavement, where it becomes stuck. There is a loud fierce growl, and the air around the gang thickens, turning even greener. A mysterious shadowy figure emerges from the sewers, still growling viciously. Daphne screams in horror, dives across Scooby, and frantically rolls up the window, the creature's hand hitting the window less than a second after it's fully closed. Everyone yells out in alarm, and the creature advances, its glowing, green claws outstretched. All of a sudden, the beast’s arms shoot out a radioactive-looking green substance, grabs hold of the Mystery Machine and picks it up, shaking the gang around while they scream out of fear. As suddenly as it attacked, the beast drops the van back to the ground, and stalks off. It disappears into the shadows, under the cover of the green smoke.)
Shaggy: (whimpers) Like, what was that?!
Fred: It looks like a mystery to me, and I think that’s just a little more important than school!

SCENE: The opening between the sewer and the old Crystal Cove caves. Fred shines a flashlight around, as the rest of the gang walks beside him. The group notices three barrels covered in green goo marked with radioactive symbols, and approaches them.
________________


Velma: These are military. From the oxidation, probably 30, 40, years old.
(Daphne pulls out a second flashlight and ventures a few feet from the others. The beam of light reveals a shiny object lying on the ground. She picks it up.)
Daphne: ​​Hey! Fred, I found something!
(She examines the magnifying glass-shaped object, and accidentally presses something on the side, causing it to open; inside is a sepia-toned picture of a boy and girl. A little tune plays as Fred walks over.)


Fred: Could be a clue. Good work, Daphne!


Daphne: Thanks, Fred; you're so sweet-- (But when she looks up again, Fred is already gone, off to investigate further.) It's okay...we can talk--later.
(Scooby sniffs around. Shaggy picks up one of the worker's hard hats. The gang hears dripping sounds. Fred shines his flashlight to see that the three workers are mummified and cocooned to the cave ceiling by green slime. Scooby screams.)
________________


SCENE: Crystal Cove streets. The police arrive at the crime scene. They take the workers into the ambulance.
________________


Sheriff Stone: All right, you see what happens when you kids stick your noses where they don't belong? People get cocooned!
Shaggy: Like, man, we found them like that.
Daphne: Sheriff, there was a monster-
Sheriff Stone: Quiet. From this point forward, this is a crime scene and future Tourist attraction. Stay out of it.
Velma: I got his "stay out of it" right here.
Fred: Let me talk to him.
Daphne: Don't worry. Fred will make him understand. 
(Fred has stolen one of the cocooned bodies. He follows Shaggy and Scooby to the Mystery Machine.)
Fred: Shaggy, start the car.
Shaggy: Wait. I thought you were going to talk to him. 
Fred: He wasn't in a listening mood.
Velma: So you stole a body? Rockin'.
(Fred throws the body into the Mystery Machine's trunk.)

SCENE: Crystal Cove High School. In the classroom, Professor Emmanuel Raffalo writes "photosynthesis" in a blackboard.
________________


Professor Raffalo: All right. Who can tell me what photosynthesis is?
(The classmates raise their hands.)
Professor Raffalo: And please don't say "plant farts."
(The classmates lower their hands. The gang arrives in the classroom with the cocooned body.)
Professor Raffalo: Huh?
Fred: Professor Raffalo? We need your help.
(The classmates flee the room as they scream.)
Professor Raffalo: Couldn't you kids have waited for break?
(Now, they all investigate the body. Raffalo uses his stethoscope to listen to it.)
Shaggy: Is he... (gulps)
Professor Raffalo: No. He's alive. But he appears to he in some sort of dehydrated stasis. I don't quite know what that means, but I'm guessing it's temporary. 
(Scooby appears to be missing during the investigation. Nearby, he finds a squirrel in an enclosure box eating snacks. He spies on some of them in a small bowl.)
Scooby: Mmm. Scooby Snacks. 
(He opens the box and takes the snacks. The squirrel notices and screeches.)
Daphne: Do you know what could have done this?
Professor Raffalo: The cocoon material looks organic, but I'll need to do further tests.
(Behind the grouo, Scooby can be seen getting attacked by the squirrel.)
Professor Raffalo: The sheriff okayed this?
(Fred hides the revelation.)
Fred: Uh, of course he did. What, do you think we stole a body? (laughs) That's-- that's rich. Ha ha.
(He escorts the others out of the classroom.)

SCENE: Fruitmeir's. The gang is seen getting ice cream while Franklin Fruitmeir makes a boat out of balloons.
________________


'Franklin Fruitmeir: Welcome, everyone, to Fruitmeir's. Remember, it's not ice cream. It's not yogurt. Would anyone like a shrimping boat made out of circus balloons?
Velma: I don't get it. All this fuss over-- What is this stuff again?
(Scooby and Shaggy arrive with a tray of green ice cream.)
Shaggy: You heard Franklin Fruitmeir. It's a secret! That's why they call it--
Scooby and Shaggy: Fruitmeir's!
(They noisly chow down on the green soft serve ice cream.)
________________


SCENE: Outside Fruitmeir's. The gang exits.
________________


Fred: Hey, you know, if that cocoon does turn out to be organic, we might have a real honest-to-goodness monster in Crystal Cove.
Velma: My guess? The cocoon is a multicelled mutation, probably a result of radiated allotropes and free radical implosion. What do you think, Shaggy? (She holds Shaggy's hand)
Shaggy: Uhh, I think I want more Fruitmeir's!
Scooby: (laughs) Yeah, me, too! (He and Shaggy enter the restaurant again)
Daphne: Velma, is there something going on between you and Shaggy?
Velma: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Why would anything ever be going on between me and Shaggy?
(Velma walks away, arms crossed. Fred and Daphne share a look at each other.)
Daphne: Well, looks like it's just us, all alone. (She and Fred walk over to the Mystery Machine) Maybe we could go for a drive, talk about that pretty locket I found. Wonder what it would be like to get such a romantic present.
Fred: Oh, come on, Daphne. You know you don't care about that girly stuff. That's why we're such good friends. I'll drop you at home. I want to get started on a new trap for the monster.
(Daphne enters the car.)
Daphne: (sighs) OK. Good luck with that.
(As Fred enters the Mystery Machine as well, the beast is heard snarling. When Daphne and Fred drive off. The beast’s eyes glow pink in the sewers.)

SCENE: Crystal Cove High School. Professor Raffalo is in the classroom, studying the cocooned body with a microscope. The beast creeps toward the classroom. Professor Raffalo hears a squishing noise.

Professor Raffalo: Huh? Someone there?
(A shadow lurks outside the door. Professor Raffalo peeks out to see that it is just the janitor mopping the floors. The janitor waves at him. Once Professor Raffalo goes back to the classroom, he is heard screaming. The janitor hears this and rushes inside the classroom, only to find that Professor Raffalo and the cocooned body are gone. When he walks off, it is revealed that Professor Raffalo has been cocooned to the ceiling by the beast.)

SCENE: K-Ghoul. Angel Dynamite talks into the microphone while podcasting.
________________


Angel Dynamite: Mmm, yeah, Crystal Cove. That was The Rotten Brains with their single "Zombie Housewife Blues." I'm Angel Dynamite, and you're listening to K-Ghoul. 101.4 on your A.M. dial.
(Outside, Scooby, Velma, Shaggy, and Daphne have arrived. Shaggy knocks on the door, getting, Angel Dynamite's attention.)
Angel Dynamite: I was wondering when y'all was going to show up. He's in the back.
(Angel leads the others to the station lounge, where they find Fred sleeping on a record player.)
Daphne: Fred. It's us. We're here for you. 
(Scooby licks Fred's hairdo, waking him up.)
Fred: It's no use, gang. I was the one who stole the body, and Professor Raffalo paid the price. I should have listened to my dad and stayed out of any new mysteries. 
Velma: We all helped steal the body, Fred.
Shaggy: Well, I actually never t-- (Velma elbows him) Ow! OK, fine. Yes. We all took part, Freddy.
Daphne: Fred Jones, you've never backed away from a mystery in your life.
Fred: I've got nothing!
Velma: Man up, Fred. We still have our first clue, the cocoon. I brought a sample-- (Scooby eats some of the goo) Scooby! What are you doing?
Scooby: What? It's Fruitmeir's! Yummy! (Continues eating)
Velma: Eww.
Angel Dynamite: Check it out. If that dog mutates, I'm putting it down, dig?
Shaggy: Like, hold on. I think I get it. (He tastes some of Fruitmeir's)
Others: Eww.
Shaggy: No, you guys, it's Fruitmeir's. The cocoon is made of the same stuff as Fruitmeir's dessert.
Others: What? (They all taste test Fruitmeir's)
Daphne: They're right. But if the cocoon is made of Fruitmeir's dessert...
Shaggy: That means if we capture the monster, we can have our own shop, and we can have an endless supply of Fruitmeir's dessert. Oh, boy.
Fred: No. It means that that slime mutant may not be a monster at all. What do we know about Franklin Fruitmeir?
(The six friends find information on the computer.)
Velma: Franklin Fruitmeir showed up in town out of nowhere 2 months ago. Before that, nothing. He's hiring right now for female servers.
Fred: Then that's our in.
Shaggy: If the girls can get jobs at Fruitmeir's, they can snoop around and find out more.
Fred: Great idea, Shag.

SCENE: Crystal Cove streets. Scooby and Shaggy are now dressed up as waitresses.
________________


Shaggy: Um. (giggles) Like, uh, this isn't exactly what I had in mind. Why are Scooby-Doo and I dressed like girls, when Velma and Daphne are girls?
Scooby: Yeah. My skirt's too tight.
Daphne: Because Velma and I refused.
(The cross-dressed boys grumble.)

SCENE: Fruitmeir's at night. Scooby and Shaggy close the restaurant while helping Franklin Fruitmeir.
________________


Franklin Fruitmeir: Good night, ladies. (singongy voice) Don't forget to lock up! 
Shaggy and Scooby: (in high-pitched voices) Good night, Mr. Fruitmeir. 
(Franklin Fruitmeir exits the restaurant while blowing up balloons. Velma, Fred, and Daphne peer out and sneak to the restaurant. Fred knocks the door, Shaggy opens it.)
Fred: All right, gang. Fan out. See if you can find anything that will tie Franklin Fruitmeir to the slime mutant. 
(The gang split up. Fred opens a cupboard to find nothing in there. Velma opens a drawer to find a box of balloons. Daphne jiggles the storage room's doorknob.)
Daphne: Hmm. Must be a key around here somewhere.
(Scooby and Shaggy pop out of a display freezer, tasting some of the green dessert.)
Scooby: All clear.
Shaggy: Let's check over there, Scoob.
(Shaggy and Scooby walk over to the storage room. Shaggy struggles to open the door, but Scooby luckily uses his claw to insert it on the keyhole to get it open. Once Shaggy opens the door, the slime mutant is in there. Scooby and Shaggy scream and dodge the slime mutant's hand.)
Shaggy: Run, Scoob!
(Daphne arrives with the keys. She gasps as she finds that the door has already opened.)
Daphne: That's strange. This closet was locked a minute ago. (Behind her, the door closes, leaving her trapped) Hey! What gives? (Bangs on the door) Freddy, help! Let me out! 
Fred: (from outside) Daphne! Hold on! We'll get you out!
(Outside, Fred and Velma struggle to open the door with wrenches. It works.)
Shaggy: Gangway! (He and Scooby crash into Daphne as they run to the storage room)
Velma: Are you two insane?
Shaggy: Mo-mo-monster! Like, right behind us!
Fred: Monster? There's no monster.
Velma: Jinkies. Where's Daphne?
(Daphne has gone. The others look for her.)
Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, and Fred: Daphne! Daphne?
Daphne: (from the bottom) Here! I'm down here! I'm OK.
(The other four find Daphne, who has fallen to the Crystal Cove caves.)
Daphne: But you better get down here. I think I found something.
