**Scooby-Doo Dialogue Across TV Shows**
DJ's and my project will calculate and compare utterances by the titular character in three different Scooby-Doo television series. We will calculate the ratio of Scooby-Doo's dialogue per episode, the mean length of utterance or MLU, and the type/token ratio to give us a better understanding of how the character's speech and positioning in the franchise has changed along with different series' production values and storytelling priorities.
